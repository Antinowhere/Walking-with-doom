Place your audio files here:

1. nice-music.mp3 - Background music for the light side
2. river-sound.mp3 - Ambient river sound effect  
3. fire-sound.mp3 - Crackling fire sound effect

The game will still work without these files, but the audio experience will be limited to the generated static noise on the dark side.
